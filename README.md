## Fork Us

If you would like to assist with the development you will need to fork our repository, clone it locally, and then start contributing.

First, you will need to have a GitHub.com account. You can sign up for free.

Then, visit our repository and click the "Fork" button at the top. This should only take a couple of seconds, then you should be redirect back to your own GitHub account with a new forked copy of our repository.

Your forked repository should live at github.com/{{your_username}}/wp-theme. For example, github.com/blove/wp-theme

Next, clone a copy of the forked repository to your computer.

### Clone via Command Line

Now that you have your own forked copy of the website repository, you can clone the repository to your local computer.

If you are using OS X then use the terminal to run the git clone command as follows, replacing {{your_username}} with your GitHub username.

`$ git clone https://github.com/{{your_username}}/wp-theme`

If you are using Windows, then you can run the **Git Cmd** application and execute the command as follows, replacing {{your_username}} with your GitHub username

`> git clone https://github.com/{{your_username}}/wp-theme`

You should now see a new folder (in the current directory where you executed the command) named 'wp-theme'.

### Clone via GitHub Desktop Application

Or, if you prefer to use the GitHub Desktop application then it is really easy to clone your forked repository.

When you first launch the GitHub Desktop application you are prompted to authenticate using your GitHub credentials. We highly recommend you do this, as it makes it very easy to clone repositories that are associated with your account (including the forked repository of the wp-theme theme).

Next, click the **+** icon in the top-left of the application, and then choose 'Clone'. If you are authenticated, you should see the 'western.oa-bsa.org' repository. Click on it to choose it, then click the large checkbox button at the bottom to 'Clone **wp-theme**'

If you already cloned the repository using the git command line interface, then you can always add the local repository to your GitHub Desktop application. Simply click on the **+** icon in the top-left of the application, and choose 'Add'. Then, browse to the location of your local Git repository and click the large checkbox button to 'Add repository'
